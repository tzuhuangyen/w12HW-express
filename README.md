      Homework Deliverable: develop a functional Express.js web server with
      basic routing and static file serving capabilities
    </h2>
<p>Development:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        1.Set up an Express.js Server Create a new Node.js project and
        initialize it with npm init. Install Express.js by running npm install
        express. Create an index.js file and set up a basic Express.js server
        that listens on port 3000.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.Create Basic Routes In your Express.js server, define the following
        routes: A GET route at / that sends a simple "Welcome to my Express.js
        server!" message. A GET route at /about that sends a brief description
        about yourself or your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.Serve Static Files Create a folder named public in your project
        directory. Inside public, create a simple HTML file named index.html.
        Add basic HTML content with a welcome message. Modify your Express.js
        server to serve the static files from the public directory. Hint: Use
        express.static middleware.
